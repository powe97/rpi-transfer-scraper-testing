These include (1) DNA structure, function, replication, and repair (2) gene expression regulation at the levels of transcription, translation, and post-translation (3) how cells obtain energy from food (4) cellular and sub-cellular structure, including membrane structure and protein transport across both internal and external membranes (5) cell signaling and communication between cells and (6) cellular replication and development, including cell division and cancer development. Understanding these concepts will help students to understand how genetic disorders and cancers can arise through errors in critical cellular processes, and students will use case studies explore how mutations in essential enzymes can cause such diseases.

Although this course focuses primarily on the destruction of the European Jews, it cannot, however, be divorced from the history of Nazi Germany, nor can it ignore the plight and suffering of non-Jews who also experienced the concentration and extermination camps. Therefore, several other themes are incorporated: Hitler\u2019s rise to power in Germany; the development and implementation of Nazi policy concerning the \u201cenemies\u201d of Nazism; life within the ghettos and concentration camps; issues of collaboration and resistance both in and outside Germany; the Nuremberg trials; and the legacy of Nazism in contemporary American and European society.

Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions.
