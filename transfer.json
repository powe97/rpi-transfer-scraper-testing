These include (1) DNA structure, function, replication, and repair (2) gene expression regulation at the levels of transcription, translation, and post-translation (3) how cells obtain energy from food (4) cellular and sub-cellular structure, including membrane structure and protein transport across both internal and external membranes (5) cell signaling and communication between cells and (6) cellular replication and development, including cell division and cancer development. Understanding these concepts will help students to understand how genetic disorders and cancers can arise through errors in critical cellular processes, and students will use case studies explore how mutations in essential enzymes can cause such diseases.

Although this course focuses primarily on the destruction of the European Jews, it cannot, however, be divorced from the history of Nazi Germany, nor can it ignore the plight and suffering of non-Jews who also experienced the concentration and extermination camps. Therefore, several other themes are incorporated: Hitler\u2019s rise to power in Germany; the development and implementation of Nazi policy concerning the \u201cenemies\u201d of Nazism; life within the ghettos and concentration camps; issues of collaboration and resistance both in and outside Germany; the Nuremberg trials; and the legacy of Nazism in contemporary American and European society.

Emphasis will be on the generation of the algorithms and problem solving. This course is offered in Python, an approachable language with relatively low syntax complexity, which allows students to concentrate on the fundamentals without becoming sidetracked by language specifics. It also affords students a tool for creating useful personal applications or prototypes in the future. Students cannot get credit for this course if they have already taken any other CSCI course.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society. Credit cannot be obtained for both IHSS 1200 and ECON 1200.",

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society. Credit cannot be obtained for both IHSS 1200 and ECON 1200.",

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society. Credit cannot be obtained for both IHSS 1200 and ECON 1200.",

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society. Credit cannot be obtained for both IHSS 1200 and ECON 1200.",

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society. Credit cannot be obtained for both IHSS 1200 and ECON 1200.",

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

The course emphasizes the importance of using advanced information systems such as the use of accounting software for small businesses and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for large companies in managerial accounting and decision making. Managerial accounting uses both financial and non-financial information; the financial accounting topics included in this course include basic financial accounting concepts and analysis of financial reports using online, interactive tools to facilitate learning. A distinction is made between external and internal reports. External reports are for information users who are external to the organization. Large corporations must prepare and file such reports for governmental and other organizations such as stock markets. An important feature of external reports is that they have a similar format, and those who prepare these reports must follow specific rules when compiling them. Internal reports, on the other hand, help managers make informed decisions in areas such as planning and controlling the organization\u2019s resources. These reports are prepared according to the managers\u2019 needs, and there are no set rules concerning their preparation. However, there is a set of principles that should be followed to ensure that these reports provide meaningful information.

The stream introduces the language of managerial accounting and teaches students to perform basic management accounting analyses (e.g., costing of cost objects, cost behavior, differential analysis, and performance measurement). The stream requires students to use the results of their analysis to evaluate the design of operations, to make strategic decisions, and to propose action. Issues covered include selecting a profitable mix of products and services, analyzing profits and costs during product development, budgeting for operations, analyzing whether to outsource or insource activities, and managing performance through measurement systems. Throughout the semester we will explore interconnections between management accounting analyses and operational actions. The sophomore management experience MAC and TOM module (SME) integrates two subject streams: Technology and Operations Management (3 credits) and Managerial Accounting (3 credits). This module focuses on the internal organization and processes required for entrepreneurial leaders and managers to successfully test and execute business strategies. To be effective, entrepreneurs and managers must design operations, model the expected performance of operational designs, make decisions that strategically manage costs, and take actions that achieve desired results in an ethical manner. The two streams in this module will help build the skills you need to become ethical entrepreneurial leaders and managers.

Governments must set basic rules for an economy, provide certain goods and services, and deal with issues of taxation, income distribution and inequality when determining how a country's resources will be used and who benefits from those resources. The Microeconomics curriculum introduces us to the rules and principles that help guide allocation decisions, and focuses particularly on the role of markets. Topics include the interaction of supply and demand in the determination of prices, demand and supply elasticities, rational choice theory, costs and efficient methods of production, market structure, wage determination, game theory for understanding firm interdependence, pricing strategy, and the role of government in correcting externalities and addressing other market failures.

Discussions and workshops are essential to the course, and regular participation and attendance are critical. In addition to short writing exercises, students also complete a two-page analytical paper that reflects a close reading of poetry or short stories. During the course, students build a polished final portfolio consisting of at least five poems and one short story of at least five pages in length.

To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society. Credit cannot be obtained for both IHSS 1200 and ECON 1200.",

While the name of the theorem foregrounds algebra, none of the known proofs is purely algebraic. Over the centuries, techniques from complex analysis, topology, and field extensions have been employed to give new proofs of the FTA.

With this course, we thus seek to put in place a framework to facilitate our own reconsideration of the famous \"quarrel between the ancients and the moderns\" on perennial questions of social and political organization. Representative texts include Aristotle's Politics and Ethics, Cicero's de Republica, Augustine's City of God, Aquinas' On Kingship, and John of Salisbury's Policraticus, in addition to Machiavelli's Prince and Discourses on Livy.",

Course presents fundamental principles of mechanics, including motion, Newton\u2019s laws, work, energy, momentum, rotation, and gravity. Conceptual development and problem solving have equal emphasis. Course Outcomes: Laboratory Skills: Use standard laboratory instruments appropriately, based on a sufficient understanding of their function; Measure physical quantities in the laboratory with appropriate attention to minimizing possible sources of random and systematic error; Make reasonable estimates of the uncertainties associated with each measurement; Evaluate a hypothesis in terms of its testability and determine the kind and amount of data required to test it; Summarize the properties of a set of data to facilitate analysis, using standard statistics such as mean and standard deviation; Determine the uncertainty of a computed quantity that arises from the uncertainties in the measured values of the quantities from which it is computed; Analyze an appropriate set of measurements for consistency with a hypothesis, form and justify a conclusion regarding the fit between the data and the hypothesis; Recognizes that measurement uncertainty is estimated as an act judgment on the part of the observer and that judgment does not imply arbitrariness. Communication Skills: Produce a compact and unambiguous verbal description of an experimental procedure and of the observations/data obtained using it; Produce a compact and unambiguous verbal description of a chain of theoretical or experimental reasoning, including clarity regarding assumptions, accuracy regarding logical connections, specificity regarding conclusions, and clarity regarding the scope (and limitations) of applicability. Kinematics objectives: Students can distinguish acceleration from velocity in diverse settings, can distinguish accelerated motions from non accelerated motions, recognize that this is a significant distinction, and can correctly determine the direction of acceleration. The student will demonstrate competence with verbal, graphical, algebraic and vector algebraic representations of motions as described below. Verbal. Correctly describe the position velocity and acceleration of an object with attention to proper use of \u201cincreasing\u201d, \u201cdecreasing\u201d or \u201cconstant\u201d (steady). Given a verbal description of the motion the student can correctly deduce the values (if given) or relative magnitudes, and signs for the position velocity and acceleration. Graphical. Given a verbal description or an observation of the motion the student can produce qualitatively correct graphs for the position velocity and acceleration. From graphs of the position velocity and acceleration (and appropriate initial conditions) students can describe the motion and the graphs with proper use of slope vs. value and \u201cincreasing\u201d, \u201cdecreasing\u201d or \u201cconstant\u201d (steady). Students are able to obtain quantitative information from graphs utilizing slope, value, area under the curve, and intersections of graph curves or intersections with the axes. Students can produce any two of the position velocity or acceleration graphs from the remaining graph and appropriate initial conditions. Algebraic. Given a verbal description, graph, or an observation of the motion the student can write an appropriate equation for the motion correctly choosing signs and values if this information is available. Students can re-arrange or combine equations algebraically before the substitution of values to solve for the desired quantities. Vector Algebraic. Students can represent the position, velocity, relative velocity or acceleration vectorially and decompose the vectors into components where appropriate. Students can perform vector arithmetic and find resultant vectors in one and two dimensions. Students can solve end of chapter problems involving one or two objects in one or two dimensions. Students will demonstrate the ability to apply representations to this process, including proper use of coordinates, selection of equations, interpretation of implicitly given information, and symbolic (rather than numeric) algebra steps. Dynamics. The student has formed a concept of Newtonian force and distinguishes force from closely related or more primitive concepts of impetus, momentum, velocity, and \u201cthe force of inertia\u201d (which is not a Newtonian force at all). For small numbers of interacting objects, the student can identify the forces of interaction, properly assign them to the system that experiences the force, and identify the object that makes the force. The student can distinguish between inertial and non-inertial reference frames, and understands that Newton\u2019s Second Law only applies to the former. The student is able to describe an operational (and non circular) method of defining mass and force using Newton\u2019s Second Law. The student correctly identifies the net force (rather that any particular force) as the cause of the acceleration (rather than causing velocity). The student can apply vector concepts to describe the effects of competing forces acting on a system. The student can correctly determine the net vector force acting on a system when three or more forces act, and can express the net force in both common vector forms. The student can apply Newton\u2019s Second law to a body in the context of end of chapter problems, utilizing Free Body Diagrams, appropriate coordinates, and any required Kinematics equations. The student can recognize action reaction pairs among the forces acting in common situations, and distinguishes these from \u201ccause/effect\u201d pairs of forces. The student Distinguishes weight from mass, and distinguishes weight from the supporting force supplied to objects by objects in the environment. The student can determine from the problem whether to go from dynamics to kinematics or the other way. Friction and Circular Motion: The student has a conceptual understanding of frictional forces as demonstrated by the ability to distinguishes and properly identify cases of static friction from cases of kinetic friction, the ability to predict the behavior of objects that are acted on by frictional forces, and by correctly distinguishing the physical meanings of the terms found in the expressions used to describe friction. The student can apply their understanding of frictional forces to the solution of end of chapter problems involving a small number of objects.",

The electromagnetic force. \u2022 The weak nuclear force. \u2022 The strong nuclear force. \u2022 Students will be able to interpret and use the vector expressions for the gravitational and electric forces., and to recognize the implications of these expressions for the analysis of many body problems by direct force calculation. Electrostatics: Context for the objectives: \u2022 Classical Physics is applied to nature by making an intellectually fruitful choice of system to study. The rest of the universe then becomes the environment for this system. This analytic dichotomy is both a goal for instruction and a context for describing the objectives below. \u2022 When the system and its environment each comprise small numbers of charges, analysis proceeds by computing the electric field or electric potential produced by the environmental charges, then computing the interaction of system charges with that field. The force (or potential energy) of that interaction then becomes an input to the mechanics problem as described in Physics 121 (114). Electrostatics General objectives: \u2022 The Student is able to make fruitful choices of system charge(s) to study and clearly distinguishes between the system and the environment. The student can distinguish between and properly associate the field (or potential) belonging to the system charge from those made by charges in the environment. \u2022 The student can generate expressions for the field (or potential) produced by the environment charges throughout the region containing the system charge(s) and determine the values for these quantities at the site of the system charge(s). \u2022 The student can generate expressions for the interaction (force or potential energy) produced by the environment charges on the system charge(s) and determine the values for these interactions as inputs to the associated mechanics problem. \u2022 The student is able to apply the learning objectives of the mechanics course to solve mechanics problems in this new context. The student has developed the awareness that the mechanics principles can be generalized beyond that course. The process described above is linear, proceeding from cause to effect. Once it is understood the student must also be able to reason (and solve problems) that begin with the effects as the inputs and have the causes as the desired goal. The Electrostatics Particular Objectives: \u2022 Students able to explain simple electrostatics experiments and charge separation phenomena using ideas of conduction, polarization of matter, and neutral pairs. \u2022 The student has an introductory understanding of the structure and constituents of atoms, molecules, crystals and amorphous solids, and can describe how these structures and the very large number of particles involved affect the electrical properties of the respective macroscopic material. \u2022 Students can identify the spectrum of electric properties of bulk matter resulting from the range of conductivity (zero to sensibly infinite) and understand the basic implications of these properties on the fields and potentials in and around matter. The student can describe these implications both microscopically and macroscopically. \u2022 Students recognize that the structure of the field (or potential) is determined by the structure of the charges. Students will demonstrate this understanding by identifying symmetries in the field (or potential) structure that arise from symmetries in the charge distribution (point vs. line vs. plane sources, E vs. B field structures).",

Course Outcomes: Thinking like physicists Outcomes: Recognize and articulate systematic behaviors in nature revealed by their own observations, especially those that are often overlooked through being obvious. Construct knowledge that does not depend on any outside authority; knowledge based on personal observation, reasoning, and possibly on physical laws or principles previously validated by the student. Students can explicitly articulate where they have done so and can devise instances where they can do this in other settings beyond the course. Demonstrate that they perceive that nature is governed by a small set of physical laws and principles and exemplify this understanding by o explicitly employing natural laws as components of a structured approach to design or problem solving. Employing a common approach to design and problem-solving in example cases that are fundamentally related but have diverse surface features. Represent the situation in general analytical, design and problem-solving settings, verbally, graphically, and mathematically, employing a structured approach to problem solving that leads from inputs to answers explicitly utilizing or respecting applicable physical laws. Exhibit a spectrum of problem solving skills including linear causal analysis, and global bookkeeping type analysis (e.g. application of conservation laws). They will productively employ methods to begin constructing solutions before the complete reasoning path is evident. Students will also develop skills needed to validate results or claims by reasoning backward to check for consistency with fundamental principles. Communications outcomes: Communicate science in authentic forms including accurate reporting of apparatus and procedures, construct arguments that reason physically from observations to conclusion using physical law and mathematics appropriately. The level of rigor expected is appropriate to the level of the course (that is, it increases through the sequence). Evaluate the quality of their observations and physical reasoning through understanding of origins and analysis of measurement uncertainty, limitations of theory and apparatus, and correct application of physical laws and principles. Read physics content written at the college level including texts, journal articles and physics problems. Interpret and generate clear physical reasoning (e.g. physics problem solutions) using multiple representations including algebraic (symbolic), numerical, graphical, oral, written, and pictorial representations. Specific Course Outcomes: Extend the \u201cThinking like a physicist\u201d outcome to discrete oscillating systems and oscillations of continuous media (and fields) obtaining in such cases the function characterizing the motion of an oscillating system or wave from which all other kinematic and dynamic features of the behavior can be calculated. They will be able in this process to employ Newton\u2019s laws, Maxwell\u2019s equations, energy considerations and assumptions about continuous media as needed in this process and will recognize the role of differential equations in the general case. Outline the path described above for damped and forced oscillating systems, and for mechanical and electromagnetic waves. Distinguish the properties of waves arising from the medium from those imposed by the boundaries (including sources). Students will exhibit this understanding by explicitly employing these distinctions to identify productive approaches to problems or when predicting the outcomes of experiments with waves. Describe Wave Optics and Geometric Optics as two physical models of the same behaviors and be able to identify the conditions that govern their respective applicability. They will be able to employ each model in appropriate settings to predict optical phenomena and behaviors and to solve typical end of chapter problems. Connect fundamental laws and physical principles to their ordinary experiences and to illustrations of experiences that they will soon encounter in their professional careers (e.g.: physics, chemistry, engineering, earth and space sciences, computer science, as well as related industries). Describe what physicists find unifying and elegant in the simplicity of having few laws of great power and be able to describe or illustrate this in a several distinct topical areas.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society. Credit cannot be obtained for both IHSS 1200 and ECON 1200.",

After they graduate, they will join new communities and continue to do so throughout their lives. Communities take many forms and every community experiences problems. The problems are often complex and solutions are rarely straightforward. Problems can be multi-faceted, ambiguous, and contentious. The perception of a problem and its solutions can be fundamentally different based on perspectives and experiences. Communities can be a formidable force in working to solve problems; communities can also play a role in exacerbating problems.

On the other hand, many in the Western world have embraced some form of metaphysical dualism, which affirms the reality of both the spiritual and the material world; still others (for example, certain Hindus) have denied all such categories, affirming that everything, except for the indivisible, indescribable One, is an illusion.

This course is an alternative to CSCI 1100 and is intended for students who want an introduction to this programming process but do not intend to do further course work in programming or computer science. Emphasis will be on the generation of the algorithms and problem solving. This course is offered in Python, an approachable language with relatively low syntax complexity, which allows students to concentrate on the fundamentals without becoming sidetracked by language specifics. It also affords students a tool for creating useful personal applications or prototypes in the future. Students cannot get credit for this course if they have already taken any other CSCI course.

Today, satirists are part of a national debate over censorship, political correctness, and jokes that 'go too far,' and some critics wonder if satire has been weaponized by the altright. In this class, we will explore different types of political satire in the United States, including digital and newspaper cartoons, stand-up comedy, tweets and memes, podcasts, and television shows like Saturday Night Live, from the 19th to the 21st centuries. We will share examples of Presidential satire leading up to the November election. And we will discuss the following questions: Can political satire produce social change? Does it function as entertainment or activism? How has political satire evolved over time? Sascha Cohen. [ ss ].",
